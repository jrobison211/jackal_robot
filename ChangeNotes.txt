High Level Questions:

Do we need anything in rover_robot? -- wrapper metapackage, i'm not sure      

Do we need anything in rover_bringup? Is it web shit?? -- the base/bringup/description paradigm is ROS best practice --> decouples robot functionality groups for separate development 
                                                       -- bringup packages all the external groups into a single launchfile access point 

Do we need to edit or remove rover_diagnostic_updater? -- probably

Do we need to edit or remove scripts/calibrate? -- probably remove


need ROS control leveragers done first -- early stage test dependencies
  --> bypass bringup, manual ssh launches should work
  --> need multialtitude understanding of ROS control workflow, integration assurance
  --> modifications to controller yamls, urdf files almost definitely necessary --> first prio in building understanding of RC is figuring out what these need to look like
  --> Â 
After roscontrol done/tested w/ serial integrations on ESP
  --> optional buildout for bringup --> ease of operation benefits, no tangible runtime effects --> consider only if launch process is lengthy/tedious enough to warrant significant speedup in testing rounds
  --> navigation integrations to Control --> parent launch file that spins up move_base, Zed (what else?)
  --> testing of full stack
